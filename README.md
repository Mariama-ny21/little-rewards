# Little Rewards

## Description
Little Rewards is a Task and Reward program for parents and children aged 4 to 10. The purpose of the website is to serve as a useful resource to parents who want to encourage and motivate their kids not only to be at their best in school, but also to take on chores around the home for small but meaningful rewards. The website helps parents to assign appropriate tasks and rewards to their children. Hence, selecting tasks and allocating appropriate rewards are key to the Little Rewards program.
